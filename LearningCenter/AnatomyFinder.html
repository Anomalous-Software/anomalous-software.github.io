      </h3>
      <p>
        The layering option works in conjunction with the Anatomy Finder task. When you click on a piece of anatomy with the Anatomy Finder enabled, the results section of the Finder box will change based on your selection to show both the anatomy on which you clicked as well as any anatomy that is either in front of or behind the anatomy clicked if you were looking at the skull as a 3D model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Example:</b> When you click on the Temporalis Muscle, your search results will show the Masticatory System, Muscular System, Skeletal System, and Skull. You can then use these results to drill down further using the Transparency Sliders available on each.
