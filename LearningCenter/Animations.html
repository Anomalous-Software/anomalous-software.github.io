We&#39;ll go over each action in detail below.</p> <a alt="" class="thickbox" href="/Files/LearningCenter/Animations/TimelineActions_Large.png" title="This is a screenshot showing the timeline actions."> <img alt="This screenshot shows the timeline actions." class="Shadow, Screenshot" src="/Files/LearningCenter/Animations/TimelineActions_Small.png" /></a>
		<p>Adding actions to the timline - Click on the plus sign symbol next to the action to add it to the timeline. The plus sign will turn blue when the mouse cursor hovers above it.

		<p><b>Quick Tip:</b> Save Often and keep timelines short. We recommend keeping timelines to 10 seconds or less for each slide; however, there are exceptions.</p>
