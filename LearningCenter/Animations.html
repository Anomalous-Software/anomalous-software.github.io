	<h1>Creating Animations</h1>
	<p>This page shows how to use the Timeline Editor to create animations to go with a slide.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<p class="col-md-6">This is the main timeline view where animations are created. When editing a slide in the authoring tools click the timeline editor button to create an animation for that slide.
			<br />
			<br /><b>Quick Tip:</b> Save Often and keep timelines short. We recommend keeping timelines to 10 seconds or less for each slide.</p><img alt="This screenshot shows the Animation Timeline interface" class="col-md-6" src="/Files/LearningCenter/Animations/AnimationTimeline_Small.png" /></div>

			<h2>Timeline Ruler</h2>
			<p>The timeline ruler is segmented into seconds. You can click on a time to move the timeline indicator to that time. Please note that if your animation contains simulation aspects it might not play the same way if you start it halfway through as it would at the beginning since the simulation might not be in the same state. However, playing an animation from the start should work consistently.</p></div>

			<h2>Timeline Actions</h2>
			<p>There are currently 10 actions available in the animation timeline editor: change medical state, highlight teeth, change layers, move camera, play sequence, muscle position, show image, show text, play sound, and show prop. Each one of these changes a particular aspect of the scene at the time it is activated.</p></div>
