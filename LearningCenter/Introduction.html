                The first time you access the Anomalous Medical software after download, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. By default, the Remember My Password box is checked. This provides you with a few benefits.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows for automatic log-in during subsequent uses of the software</li>
                <li>Allows you to access the software even if your computer does not have an Internet Connection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> If you have forgotten your password, just click on the Forgot Password button in the bottom right hand corner of the log-in box. You will be redirected to the Forgot Password webpage at the Anomalous Medical site where you will be prompted to enter the email address associated with your account.
