        Selection Modes and Transparency allow you to more fully customize the anatomy shown
        in the stage area. Once you choose a camera angle that best meets your needs, you
        can then customize the anatomy further using these tools.

                <li>
                    Individual - this selection mode allows you to select specific pieces of anatomy,
                    for example, a single tooth - Please note that this mode is only available in the

                Another way to customize the anatomy is by adjusting the transparency levels.
