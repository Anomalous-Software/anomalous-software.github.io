            Selection Modes and Transparency</h1>
        <p>
            Selection Modes and Transparency allow you to more fully customize the anatomy shown
            in the stage area. Once you choose a camera angle that best meets your needs, you
            can then customize the anatomy further using these tools.</p>
        <h2>
            Selection Mode</h2>

        <p>
            The Selection Mode Task is available when you click on the blue Anomalous Medical
            button in the top, left-hand corner of the screen.</p>
        <p class="Note">
            <b>REMINDER:</b> Remember that you can drag frequently used tasks to your Task Bar.
            Simply click the blue Anomalous Medical button in the top, left-hand side of the
            screen which will expand your list of available tasks. Left-Click and hold down
            the mouse button on a task that you use frequently. Drag your mouse up until the
            Task appears over the Task Bar at the top of your window. Release the mouse button.</p>
        <p>
            Select the <b>Selection</b> Mode task to open it on your stage. Depending on your
            version, you will see available selection modes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Group - this selection mode is selected by default and allows you to select objects
                within a group, for example, by clicking on one of the teeth, you select all of
                them</li>
            <li>None - this selection mode allows you to navigate using your mouse without accidentally
                selecting anatomy</li>
            <li>Individual - this selection mode allows you to select specific pieces of anatomy,
                for example, a single tooth - Please note that this mode is only available in the
                Premium Features download</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note">
            <b>QUICK TIP:</b> You can use the Tab key on your keyboard to navigate between selection
            modes as you work.</p>
        <h2>
            Transparency</h2>

        <p>
            Another way to customize the anatomy is by adjusting the transparency levels.</p>
        <p class="Note">
            <b>QUICK TIP:</b> To adjust the transparency of an anatomy group, first makes sure
            your Selection Mode is set to Group. Click on a piece of anatomy to activate the
            Transparency Slider.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Files/LearningCenter/SelectionModes/image13.jpg" align="center" style='margin-left: 200px;
                text-align: center' /></p>
        <p>
            Slide the arrow to the left to increase transparency and to the right to decrease
            transparency. To close the Transparency Slider box, click on the X in the top, right-hand
            corner. <b>NOTE:</b> You must make the skin completely transparent by sliding the
            transparency slider all the way to the left before you can adjust the transparency
            levels of internal anatomy groups.</p>
        <p>
            <b>QUICK TIP:</b> To restore the External Anatomy once completely transparent, open
            the Anatomy Finder (discussed in the next section) and click on <b>Unhide</b> at
            the top.</p>
